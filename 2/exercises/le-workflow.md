## Getting Started
So you're running a project at DEV.  You should have an Account Manager, Designer and Engineering Team working with you to make the project a success.  This will likely be one of the more challenging leadership experiences you'll have – managing your peers is always hard, doubly so when they are Harvard students – it will also be one the most rewarding.  One of the truly unique things about DEV is the fact that we rely on young, relatively inexperienced people to quickly ramp into leadership roles on large projects. It has worked very well for us in the past, and I'm confident the model will continue to prove successful moving forward.
#### Initial Meeting
Every semester (Fall, Spring, Summer) at DEV, we will start with a project kickoff meeting.  There, we introduce the projects that we'll be working on, as well as the teams that will be running them.  Afterwards, we break out into the different project units for the initial team meeting.  This is your first opporunity to meet with your team and establish an initial rapport.  Take this time to introduce yourself and make sure everyone on your team knows who each other are (if necessary, break out some ice breaker games).  After that, have everyone pull out their calendars and set up times for weekly meetings
