## Getting Started
So you're running a project at DEV.  You should have an Account Manager, Designer and Engineering Team working with you to make the project a success.  This will likely be one of the more challenging leadership experiences you'll have – managing your peers is always hard, doubly so when they are Harvard students – it will also be one the most rewarding.  One of the truly unique things about DEV is the fact that we rely on young, relatively inexperienced people to quickly ramp into leadership roles on large projects. It has worked very well for us in the past, and I'm confident the model will continue to prove successful moving forward.
