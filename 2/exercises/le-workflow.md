## Getting Started
So you're running a project at DEV.  You should have an Account Manager, Designer and Engineering Team working with you to make the project a success.  This will likely be one of the more challenging leadership experiences you'll have – managing your peers is always hard, doubly so when they are Harvard students – it will also be one the most rewarding.  One of the truly unique things about DEV is the fact that we rely on young, relatively inexperienced people to quickly ramp into leadership roles on large projects. It has worked very well for us in the past, and I'm confident the model will continue to prove successful moving forward.
#### Initial Meeting
Every semester (Fall, Spring, Summer) at DEV, we will start with a project kickoff meeting.  There, we introduce the projects that we'll be working on, as well as the teams that will be running them.  Afterwards, we break out into the different project units for the initial team meeting.  This is your first opporunity to meet with your team and establish an initial rapport.  Take this time to introduce yourself and make sure everyone on your team knows who each other are (if necessary, break out some ice breaker games).  This is also a great opporunity to motivate why this is a cool/impactful project.  Engineers don't enjoy coding on projects that they don't think are useful or boring.  Part of your role as Lead Engineer is being a cheerleader, emphasising why the project is worth working on (e.g. "Once we finish this project, the client will have a totally revamped online brand presence", "It's actually a really cool idea and I'm definitely excited to use it once we build it!", etc).  This will pay off in your engineers working harder and caring more about their work.

After that, have everyone pull out their calendars and set up times for weekly meetings and office hours.  There's always a lot of enthusiasm at the start of projects: it's exciting to work on a new project with a new team. It's important to not let that momentum go to waste, and be ready ASAP with a ready codebase and issues to work on.  The next sections will walk you through how to set up your project's codebase and PM(Project Management) toolkit:
